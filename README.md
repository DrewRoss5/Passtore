# Passtore
A Minimalist Password manager for Linux<br><br>
<b>⚠ WARNING: ⚠</b><br> This password manager uses AES-256-GCM encryption, however, it was made as a hobby/educational project, so it has not been professionally audited for security. <b>Use with caution!</b>

# Roadmap
<ul>
  <li>Finish documentation</li>
  <li>Create an installer</li>
  <li>Add support for multiple password files</li>
  <li>Add a password strength checker</li>
  <li>Add more password attributes (usernames, etc.)</li>
  <li>Add support for UI customization</li>
  <li>Add support for Windows</li>
</ul>

# Usage:

### Installation:
Until an offical installer is written, the best way to use passtore is to download the repo, and from its folder run the following command<br>
<code>python src/main.py</code><br><br>
You will need the following python libraries installed to run passtore this way:
<ul>
  <li>PySide6</li>
  <li>PyCryptodome</li>
  <li>Pyperclip</li>
</ul>



### Initial Run:
When first using Passtore, you will be greeted with the following screen: <br>
![2023-10-29_15-51](https://github.com/DrewRoss5/passtore/assets/145530440/fb815ed4-0332-4fa6-bd13-bdd3a30cf1ef)
<br>This is the dialog for the user to create a new password file. The file path you choose is where your password database file will be stored.  It is highly important to choose a secure password, because the password entered on this screen will serve as the password database's master password, and will be used to derive the 256-bit AES key that is used to encrypt your passwords. On your first time running the program, this dialog also creates a prefs file at <code>"/home/yourusername/.passtore".</code> Once created, the password database file will have an example password automatically inserted. After you have created a password database, if the creation is succesful, you will get the following dialog:<br>![2023-10-29_16-03](https://github.com/DrewRoss5/passtore/assets/145530440/b11f143b-7588-4271-afbe-c64af290711c)<br>Passtore will close at this time. When you reopen the applica
tion, you will be greeted with a login prompt to unlock your password database.

### The Passtore User Interface
Once you login to passtore, and your password database is decrypted, you should an interface very simmilar to this one:<br>
![2023-10-29_16-08](https://github.com/DrewRoss5/passtore/assets/145530440/3d4b52f1-b3d8-4f28-b540-50624873afbe)
<br>
From here, you can create, delete, edit, and access passwords.<br>
NOTE: All changes made to the passtore database are not commited to the file, unless explicitly saved.
#### Accessing passwords:
In order to prevent shoulder surfing, passwords are never shown as plaintext in passtore, and instead are copied directly to the user's clipboard. To copy a password, simply select in the list, and double click it, press Ctrl+C or press the "Copy" button on the user interface.
#### Creating passwords:
To create a password, press the "New" button on the user interface. This will open the following menu:<br>
![2023-10-29_16-25](https://github.com/DrewRoss5/passtore/assets/145530440/ae0990c0-42e8-4452-a5b3-1a4cd5f80f1f)<br>
The "site name" is the name your password will be stored under in the password database. Each password must have a unique site name, so no repeat names are allowed. Opening the menu, there will by default be a randomly generated password that is sixteen characters long, the random password is generated by base64 encoding bytes from <code>/dev/urandom</code> on Unix-based opperating systems. Moving the slider will generate a new password of the newly specified length. You may, of course, simply use your own password as well, or edit the randomly generated one.
