# passtore
A Minimalist Password manager for Linux<br><br>
<b>⚠ WARNING: ⚠</b><br> This password manager uses AES-256-GCM encryption, however, it was made as a hobby/educational project, so it has not been professionally audited for security. <b>Use with caution!</b>

# Roadmap
<ul>
  <li>Write documentation</li>
  <li>Create an installer</li>
  <li>Add support for multiple password files</li>
  <li>Add more password attributes (usernames, etc.)</li>
  <li>Add support for UI customization</li>
  <li>Add support for Windows</li>
</ul>

# Usage:
Until an offical installer is written, the best way to use passtore is to download the repo, and from its folder run the following command<br>
<code>python src/main.py</code>
