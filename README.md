# Passtore
A Minimalist cross-platform password manager<br><br>
<b>⚠ WARNING: ⚠</b><br> This password manager uses AES-256-GCM encryption, however, it was made as a hobby/educational project, so it has not been professionally audited for security. <b>Use with caution!</b>

# Roadmap
<ul>
  <li>Finish documentation</li>
  <li>Create an installer</li>
  <li>Add a password strength checker</li>
  <li>Add more password attributes (usernames, etc.)</li>
  <li>Add support for UI customization</li>
</ul>

# Usage
### Initial Run:
When first using Passtore, you will be greeted with the following screen: <br>
![2023-10-29_15-51](https://github.com/DrewRoss5/passtore/assets/145530440/fb815ed4-0332-4fa6-bd13-bdd3a30cf1ef)
<br>This is the dialog for the user to create a new password file. The file path you choose is where your password database file will be stored.  It is highly important to choose a secure password, because the password entered on this screen will serve as the password database's master password, and will be used to derive the 256-bit AES key that is used to encrypt your passwords. On your first time running the program, this dialog also creates a prefs file at <code>"/home/yourusername/.passtore".</code> Once created, the password database file will have an example password automatically inserted. After you have created a password database, if the creation is succesful, you will get the following dialog:<br>![2023-10-29_16-03](https://github.com/DrewRoss5/passtore/assets/145530440/b11f143b-7588-4271-afbe-c64af290711c)<br>Passtore will close at this time. When you reopen the applica
tion, you will be greeted with a login prompt to unlock your password database.

### The Passtore User Interface
Once you login to passtore, and your password database is decrypted, you should an interface very simmilar to this one:<br>
![2023-10-29_16-08](https://github.com/DrewRoss5/passtore/assets/145530440/3d4b52f1-b3d8-4f28-b540-50624873afbe)
<br>
From here, you can create, delete, edit, and access passwords.<br>
NOTE: All changes made to the passtore database are not commited to the file, unless explicitly saved.
#### Accessing passwords:
In order to prevent shoulder surfing, passwords are never shown as plaintext in passtore, and instead are copied directly to the user's clipboard. To copy a password, simply select in the list, and double click it, press Ctrl+C or press the "Copy" button on the user interface.
#### Creating passwords:
To create a password, press the "New" button on the user interface. This will open the following menu:<br>
![2023-10-29_16-25](https://github.com/DrewRoss5/passtore/assets/145530440/ae0990c0-42e8-4452-a5b3-1a4cd5f80f1f)<br>
The "site name" is the name your password will be stored under in the password database. Each password must have a unique site name, so no repeat names are allowed. Opening the menu, there will by default be a randomly generated password that is sixteen characters long, the random password is generated by base64 encoding bytes from <code>/dev/urandom</code> on Unix-based opperating systems. Moving the slider will generate a new password of the newly specified length. You also may, of course, simply use your own password or edit the randomly generated one. 


# Password Database Files (.pwdb)
#### Encryption
Password database files are used to store and decrypt your passwords. Each password has a seperate 256-bit key, which is generated by hashing the master password with a randomly generated salt. The names of passwords, as well as the randomly generated salts are encrypted with an AES-256-GCM Cipher, which uses a SHA256-hash of the master password (known as the master key) as a key. The GCM mode of opperation for encryption was choosen to protect from corruption/data alteration.
#### File Format
The first line of .pwdb file is bcrypt hash of the master key, this used for password validation purposes when attempting to decrypt the database. Every additional line consists of the auth tag, nonce, and ciphertext, seperarated by a colon, of the password's site name, salt, and content. The name, salt, and ciphertext are each seperated by exclamation marks.

Outside contributions are not being accepted at this time, however, they may be accepted once the project is more mature.
